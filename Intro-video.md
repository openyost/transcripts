hey friends I'm Yost my
pronouns are they/them
I am a queer
seminarian ( non-binary bisexual)
and
Christian and
I'm actively pursuing
ordination in the United Methodist
Church so
I'd love to take
time to just answer whatever
questions you have about LGBTQIA
people. if you're parents
of a Queer kid or if
you are Queer
yourself and you're trying to
understand
how does that fit with your faith
I'd love to have those
conversations with you so go
ahead and drop your
questions in the comments
or reach out to me on Instagram
with your questions
on Instagram you also find
a link to book a
one-on-one conversation with me so
that
we can talk about any
questions that you have
in a more private manner than just
you asking something and 
me making videos
so I'd love to hear from you
