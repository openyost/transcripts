To answer this question. I'm
going to look at two different
ways that I think. or at least my
current favorite ways that the
lgbtq community glorifies
God.
I want to start first with Genesis 1
first start first account of
creation it
in its is this beautiful poem
looking at how God created
and separated and
names and
and celebrated diverse things like
day and night
water and Sky
Earth and the seas
the sun in the Moon
sea animals
and Sky animals
Queer people, as we label
ourselves, We're participating in
the ongoing creation of the universe
we're discovering where we belong
and to whom
we belong
and who is like us
and celebrating how we're all
different from
each other at the same
time it's like the late
pedagogue, Paulo Freire talks
about how getting
the language to describe out
situation is liberating
